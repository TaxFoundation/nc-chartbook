State economies are diverse, and different areas of a state often have unique local economies, which can be seen by comparing the largest sectors (based on the share of area total employment) in metro versus non-metro North Carolina.

For example (and not surprisingly), agriculture makes up 4.3 percent of North Carolina’s non-metro employment but only 1 percent of metro-area employment. Similarly, while manufacturing, government, and retail trade are prominent in both areas, these sectors make up a larger share of employment in non-metro areas of the state. Services such as accommodation and food, administrative, and professional services are more prominent in metro areas.
