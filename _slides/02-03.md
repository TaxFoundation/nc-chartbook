The absence of a major tax is a common factor among many of the top ten states in the *Index*. Wyoming and South Dakota have no corporate or individual income tax; Alaska has no individual income or state-level sales tax; Florida and Nevada have no individual income tax; and New Hampshire and Montana have no sales tax. Indiana and Utah, on the other hand, have all of the major tax types, but levy them with low rates on broad bases, earning them spots in the top ten as well. The states in the bottom ten all suffer from the same afflictions: complex, non-neutral taxes with comparatively high rates.

> Note: A rank of 1 indicates the state’s tax system is more favorable for business; a rank of 50 indicates the state’s tax system is less favorable for business. The (\*) next to North Carolina’s rank indicates that the 16th best score is the state’s 2015 score, an improvement from 44th best in 2014. The state is projected to improve even further to 13th if all planned reforms continue as scheduled.
