North Carolina has historically been more dependent on goods production than the U.S. as a whole due to its more pronounced manufacturing sector. But like all states, the share of the total economy that involves the production of goods has declined over time as the services share has grown. Fifty years ago, 55 percent of the North Carolina economy was derived from goods production, while only 30 percent came from goods in 2014. This has far-reaching implications for the sales tax base, which traditionally focuses on the taxation of transactions involving the exchange of tangible goods, not services.
