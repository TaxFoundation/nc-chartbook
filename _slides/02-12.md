Once North Carolina’s new lower corporate income tax rate of 3 percent is phased in (assuming that the state meets the general fund tax revenue requirements outlined under the revenue trigger mechanism), North Carolina’s tax rate will be the lowest in the country among states levying a corporate income tax.

> Note: The map shows the maximum statutory tax rate in each state. All tax rates except North Carolina’s are as of April 15, 2015. North Carolina’s rate is the rate scheduled to take effect in 2017. Connecticut’s rate includes a 20% surtax. Illinois’ rate includes two separate corporate income tax rates. Nevada, Ohio, Texas, and Washington have statewide gross receipts taxes with rates not strictly comparable to corporate income taxes. Some states, including Virginia and Delaware, levy widespread local gross receipts taxes in addition to corporate income taxes.
