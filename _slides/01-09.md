Disposable income is a measure of income available after taxes are paid. North Carolina disposable income per capita has historically been below the U.S. average, though that gap began to close in the 1990s. Since the early 2000s, however, the gap has begun to widen again. North Carolina’s disposable income per capita in 2014 was $35,437, while the U.S. level was $40,670 that year.
