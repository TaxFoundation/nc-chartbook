Breaking the State Business Tax Climate Index into its subcomponents allows us to compare the structure of each major tax type. Here, we look at the structure of North Carolina’s post-reform sales taxes. Once all reforms are in effect, North Carolina will have the 33rd best sales tax code in the country. Its sales tax structure is outranked by all competitor states except Texas—meaning North Carolina still has plenty of work to do in this category.

> Note: The figure shows projected sales tax component rankings once all of North Carolina’s sales tax changes are phased in.
