Expanding the sales tax to services can be politically difficult, but it is still smart policy. North Carolina has moved in the right direction by adding certain service contracts and services purchased with goods (like repair services bought alongside parts) to the sales tax base. But there’s still plenty of work to do to expand the sales tax to many common consumer purchases, like landscaping, parking, and gym memberships. Any sales tax expansion to services needs to include a robust business-to-business exemption to ensure that services purchased by businesses aren’t taxed. When a business pays taxes on inputs, the final good or service purchased by consumers is taxed multiple times.
