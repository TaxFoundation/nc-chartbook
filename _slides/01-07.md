Like businesses, employment levels also fluctuate over time. While the total number of jobs in a state is a valuable statistic, it’s also interesting to look at the composition of jobs by sector over time. Manufacturing has historically been an important sector in North Carolina, but manufacturing’s share of total jobs in the state has declined over the years, while government’s and service jobs’ shares have increased. It’s important to note that while some sectors, such as financial activities, employ fewer people, they still contribute significantly to total state production.

> Note: Mining and logging are such a small percentage of total employment that they are not visible in this chart. Miscellaneous Services includes the information sector.
