The *State Business Tax Climate Index* gauges how well structured each state’s tax code is for business. States that score well on the Index have broad bases and low rates, but North Carolina had narrow bases and high rates on many taxes. North Carolina ranked 44th in the country prior to its reforms and had a worse rank than all six competitor states.

> Note: This shows rankings based on 2014 Index scores, which are based on law as of July 1, 2013 (prior to the North Carolina reforms’ effective dates).
