The sweeping tax reforms made in the Tar Heel State shouldn’t be the end of the road. North Carolina could still make improvements to its tax structure, especially when it comes to broadening bases.

In particular, North Carolina still has narrow sales and corporate income tax bases. By broadening both of these, overall rates could be reduced, making North Carolina even more competitive nationally. The state has made moderate strides toward sales tax base broadening in the last several years, but a main component of the modern economy is still missing from the base: consumer services.

On the corporate income tax side, North Carolina still has several business tax incentive programs that narrow the tax base and make the tax code less neutral, forcing the overall tax rate to be higher than it would be otherwise.

Finally, North Carolina still has a capital stock tax, a tax that less than half of the states impose and that’s a deterrent to capital formation—which is no way to encourage economic growth.
