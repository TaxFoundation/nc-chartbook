North Carolina made sweeping changes to its tax code during the 2013 legislative session and built on those reforms in 2014 and 2015â€”enough to move the state from having the 44th best tax code in the country to the 13th best tax code in the country once reforms are fully phased in, according to the State Business Tax Climate Index.

We explain the big changes made to the individual income tax, business taxes, sales taxes, and finally the estate tax.
