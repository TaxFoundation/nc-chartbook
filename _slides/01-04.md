North Carolina obtained the largest share of state government tax collections in the 2012 fiscal year from individual income taxes (46 percent of total), followed by sales taxes (25 percent), and excise taxes (17 percent). As in most states, corporate income taxes make up the smallest share of state tax collections in North Carolina (5 percent) among major tax types.

North Carolina relied less on individual income taxes as a revenue source in fiscal year 2012 than Georgia (where individual income taxes made up 49 percent of state tax collections), Massachusetts (50 percent of state tax collections), and Virginia (56 percent of collections), but more than South Carolina (38 percent) and Florida and Texas, which donâ€™t levy individual income taxes. Sales tax reliance is much more prominent in Florida and Texas, which obtained 59 percent and 60 percent of their total tax collections from this source, respectively.
