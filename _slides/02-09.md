Firms that pay individual income taxes rather than corporate income taxes are known as “pass-through” or “flow-through” entities because business income “flows through” to the owner’s individual income tax return. Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations are all types of pass-through businesses (note that LLCs are included in these categories by the Census Bureau).

Sixty-two percent of all employers with payroll in North Carolina are pass-through entities, but that share varies for specific sectors of the economy. It’s important to note, however, that when we consider the aggregate number of workers at businesses with payroll in North Carolina, most of them work at traditional corporations (known as C-corporations).
