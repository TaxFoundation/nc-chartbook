Breaking the *State Business Tax Climate Index* into its subcomponents allows us to compare the structure of each major tax type. Here, we look at the structure of North Carolina’s post-reform individual income tax, after all tax changes have been phased in. Once all reforms are in effect, North Carolina will have the 14th best individual income tax code in the country. Among competitor states, it will be outranked by Florida and Texas (which don’t levy individual income taxes), as well as Massachusetts (which has a lower flat rate at 5.15 percent).

> Note: The figure shows projected individual income tax component rankings once all North Carolina income tax changes are phased in (including the 5.499 percent rate in 2017). Florida ranks better than Texas because the *State Business Tax Climate Index* takes S-corporations and LLCs (which are taxed under the individual income tax code) into account, which are subject to taxation by the Margin Tax, a gross receipts tax in Texas.
