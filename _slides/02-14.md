Breaking the *State Business Tax Climate Index* into its subcomponents allows us to compare the structure of each major tax type. Here, we look at the structure of North Carolina’s post-reform corporate taxes, after all tax changes have been phased in. Once all reforms are in effect, North Carolina will have the 4th best corporate tax code in the country and will outrank all competitor states’ corporate tax structures.

> Note: The figure shows the projected corporate income tax component ranking once all of North Carolina’s corporate tax changes are phased in (including the 3 percent corporate income tax rate in 2017).
