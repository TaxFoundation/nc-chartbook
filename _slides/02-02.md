Our *State Business Tax Climate Index* compares the structure of state tax codes on over 100 variables to determine which states have the best and worst climates for business. The result is a relative ranking of all 50 states, in which a ranking of 1 indicates the best climate for business and a ranking of 50 indicates the worst.

Prior to North Carolina’s historic tax reforms, the Tar Heel State was in the bottom ten, ranking 46th in 2011 and moving up slightly to 44th in 2013 (we’ve chosen 2014 *Index* scores as our “before” snapshot, since they reflect laws as of July 1, 2013, which was before any tax reform legislation took effect). Post-reform, North Carolina’s ranking skyrocketed to 16th best in 2015. It’s expected to reach 13th best once reforms are fully phased in and the revenue trigger is met.

> Note: Projected rankings use 2015 rankings as a baseline. That is, North Carolina’s scheduled future changes are considered alongside the tax codes of other states as of July 1, 2014 (the start of the 2015 standard state fiscal year).
