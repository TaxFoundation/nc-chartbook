In addition to the federal estate tax, many states levy their own estate and inheritance taxes. Estate taxes are charged directly against the estate, while inheritance taxes are levied on inheritors, based on their relationships to the deceased. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have an estate tax, and six states have an inheritance tax. Maryland and New Jersey have both. North Carolina repealed its estate tax—a smart policy move given death taxes’ high compliance costs, detrimental economic effects, and low share of total state tax collections.
