North Carolina’s total state and local tax burden was ranked 20th highest in the country as of the 2012 fiscal year. At 9.8 percent of total state income, North Carolina was just below the national average of 9.9 percent, but higher than all competitor states except one (Massachusetts). The average North Carolina taxpayer paid $3,659 in all state and local taxes in 2012. Approximately 74 percent of that total tax burden was paid to state and local governments within North Carolina, with the remainder paid to out-of-state jurisdictions.

North Carolina taxpayers pay state and local taxes not only to North Carolina but also to other state and local governments. For example, sales and excise taxes are paid by North Carolina residents when they travel to other states and spend money on lodging and food.
