Before its major tax overhaul, North Carolina was a state with a surprisingly high tax burden compared to its neighbors, coupled with a poorly structured tax code. Pre-reform, the Tar Heel State’s tax system ranked 44th in the country—meaning that only six states had less-competitive tax codes than North Carolina.

In this chapter, we introduce North Carolina and the six key states we’ve identified as economic competitors for attracting people and business. We briefly walk through each state’s economy before explaining the relative tax structure of each—including how they compare nationally and also to one another. We’ll examine the relative tax burden of each state and delve into how North Carolina’s tax code functioned prior to the implementation of the ongoing multi-year tax reform. Finally, we’ll explore some key details about the North Carolina economy, including how it has fared over the business cycle, what kinds of jobs North Carolinians have, trends in disposable income, and geographic migration patterns.
