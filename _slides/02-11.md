North Carolina’s corporate income tax was enacted in 1921 at a rate of 3 percent. The rate increased over the years until it peaked at 7.75 percent in the early 1990s, then dropped to 6.9 percent in 2001. The rate did not change again until 2014, when it dropped to 6 percent, then to 5 percent in 2015. The tax reforms built in a “trigger mechanism,” automatically reducing the rate in future years if revenue targets are met. The first target was met during the 2015 fiscal year, lowering the rate to 4 percent in 2016. If the next revenue target is met, the rate will drop to 3 percent, making North Carolina’s corporate income tax rate the lowest in the country among the states levying corporate income taxes.
