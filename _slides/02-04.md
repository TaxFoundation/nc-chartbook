From its inception in 1921 through the 2000s, the North Carolina individual income tax had multiple brackets, with rates ranging from 3 to 8.25 percent. In 2014, the individual income tax changed dramatically to a flat rate of 5.8 percent on all income levels, followed by a further decline to 5.75 percent in 2015. The rate is scheduled to go down even further in 2017 to 5.499 percent, which would make it the lowest rate among our key competitor states levying an individual income tax.
