Fewer than half of the states in the U.S. levy a capital stock tax, an economically damaging tax imposed at a low rate but directly on business capital. These taxes are levied on the net assets or market capitalization of a business entity. The North Carolina capital stock tax is formally known as the “Franchise Tax” and is levied at a rate of 0.15 percent, with no limit on the maximum payment. These taxes discourage capital formation and are a deterrent to economic growth and development.

> Note: Missouri, New York, and Pennsylvania are in the process of phasing out their capital stock taxes. Rhode Island and West Virginia just finished phasing out their capital stock taxes. (\*) indicates that taxpayers pay the greater of corporate income tax or capital stock tax liability, but not both. See Table 33 of Tax Foundation, *Facts & Figures 2015: How Does Your State Compare?* for more information on each state’s capital stock tax rate and maximum payment.
