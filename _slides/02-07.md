An income tax expenditure is a tax preference (given via an exclusion, deduction, credit, lower rate, or some other means), making the tax on that income less than it would have been otherwise. There are tax expenditures that ensure a well-structured tax base, and there are those known as “policy decisions” that give preference to certain activities or income under the tax code. Policy decisions narrow the tax base, forcing the tax rate to be higher than it would be otherwise to raise the same amount of revenue.

North Carolina’s tax reform dramatically reduced the number of “policy decision” tax expenditures in the North Carolina individual income tax code. Eliminating existing tax preferences and broadening the tax base allowed lawmakers to lower the individual income tax rate for all taxpayers.
