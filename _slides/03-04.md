While North Carolina had a total of 69 corporate income tax expenditures on the books in their most recent Tax Expenditure Report, it’s important to distinguish between different types of expenditures. Administrative and structural provisions are tools used to ensure the proper definition of income, avoid double taxation, and account for intergovernmental transactions. Approximately 26 percent of North Carolina’s corporate income tax expenditures fall into this category. The remaining expenditures are carve-outs that are meant to encourage certain behaviors by businesses (such as moving toward renewable energy or creating jobs), but ultimately narrow the tax base, lead to a non-neutral tax code, and frequently fail to bring about the desired outcomes. A better approach to tax policy is to eliminate these types of tax expenditures so that the rate for all firms can be reduced.
