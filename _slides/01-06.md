One way to examine the impact of business cycles is to look at the behavior of in-state businesses, such as the number of businesses that are opening or closing and expanding or contracting each year. The North Carolina economy saw significant contractions in the most recent recession and had yet to recover from these as of 2012. It is estimated that the state saw almost 68,000 establishment contractions in 2009—most of which were in the retail, construction, and accommodation and food service industries.

As with most states, it is more common for firms to expand and contract rather than to close or open in North Carolina. In 2009, there were just over 25,000 establishment closings. Establishment closings were most heavily concentrated in the construction sector, followed by retail trade and professional, scientific, and technical services.
